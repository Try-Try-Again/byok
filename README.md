# Hulix - a bare-metal x86 Forth interpreter

A toy implementation of a [Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language))
interpreter, running directly on top of an x86 machine.

## Setup / Building

For development and testing, using [QEMU](http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page) is recommended. 
Using bochs, virtual box or VMware should equally work.

From Ubuntu command line:

    $ sudo apt-get install qemu-system-x86 ghex nasm xorriso make

Building requires a barebones [i686-elf cross compiler](https://github.com/rm-hull/i686-elf) 
installing first. Follow the instructions on that page, and then check it works by running:

    $ i686-elf-gcc --version
    i686-elf-gcc (GCC) 4.9.1

Next, to completely rebuild the kernel:

    $ make clean
    $ make build

To build an ISO image of the kernel:

    $ make iso

This may then either be burned onto a CD-ROM, or loaded onto a USB stick. Alternatively, 
running it in qemu:

    $ make qemu

## Implementation Notes

Portions of infrastructure of this interpreter are derived from [osdev](http://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page)'s 
meaty skeleton.

## TODO

Some basic kernel operations need writing before work on the interpreter can be started:

* ~~Scrolling TTY~~
* ~~Control character output~~
* ~~printf %d and %x formats~~
* Debug printing
* ~~Global Descriptor Table~~
* ~~Interrupt Descriptor Table~~
* ~~Interrupt Service Routines / Exception handling~~
* Keyboard driver - entry & readline input
* ~~Memory allocator~~
* ~~sbrk implementation~~
